### Hi there my name's Joe ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**rogcomfox/rogcomfox** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Freelance Mobile Developer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS app development and Neural Network
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about mobile development, History and Culture, and also about Computer Vision

Thank you for see this readme :)
